<h3>Tensor recovery</h3>

<td align="left"><p>This work proposes a systematic model reduction approach based on rank adaptive tensor recovery for partial differential equation (PDE) models with high-dimensional random parameters. Since the standard outputs of interest of these models are discrete solutions on given physical grids which are high-dimensional, we use kernel principal component analysis to construct stochastic collocation approximations in reduced dimensional spaces of the outputs. To address the issue of high-dimensional random inputs, we develop a new efficient rank adaptive tensor recovery approach to compute the collocation coefficients. 
Novel  efficient initialization strategies for non-convex optimization problems involved in tensor recovery are also developed in this work. </p>

<h3>Failure probability estimation</h3>

<td align="left"><p>Failure probability evaluation for complex physical and engineering systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are computationally intensive, especially when high-dimensional random parameters are involved. Since standard numerical schemes for solving these complex PDEsare  expensive, traditional Monte Carlo methods which require repeatedly solving PDEs are infeasible. Alternative approaches which are typically the surrogate based methods suffer from the so-called curseof dimensionality, which limits their application to problems with high-dimensional parameters. For this purpose, we  develop a novel hierarchical neural hybrid (HNH) method to efficiently compute failure probabilities of these challenging high-dimensional problems. Especially,  multifidelity surrogates areconstructed based on neural networks with different levels of layers, such that expensive highfidelity surrogates are adapted only when the parameters are in the suspicious domain. The efficiency of our new HNH method is theoretically analyzed and is demonstrated with numerical experiments. From numerical results, we show that to achieve an accuracy in estimating the rare failure probability (e.g.,10âˆ’5), the traditional Monte Carlo method needs to  solve PDEs more than a million times, while our HNH only requires solving them a few thousand times.</p>

<h3>Density estimation and its applications</h3>

<img src="pic/pdf1.png" alt="alt text" width="130px" height="130px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>In this work, we develop an invertible transport map, called KRnet, for density estimation by coupling the Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement and the flow-based generative model, which generalizes the real NVP model. The triangular structure of the KR rearrangement breaks the symmetry of the real NVP in terms of the exchange of information between dimensions, which not only accelerates the training process but also improves the accuracy significantly. We use KRnet as a PDF model to approximate the Fokker-Planck equation to alleviate the difficulties from the curse of dimensionality. Difficulties caused by the boundary conditions and the nonnegativity of PDF have disappeared since KRnet is a family of probability density functions. To result in effective stochastic
collocation points for training KRnet, we develop an adaptive sampling procedure, where samples are generated iteratively using KRnet at each iteration.</p>
